!> **Warning:** In Vault versions 1.20 and earlier, attributes of type list had a different behavior
with `allowed_parameters` and `denied_parameters`. In order for the list to be considered
allowed, it didn't matter that all values in the list were individually allowed, as the
whole list had to be defined as a single allowed value. This has been changed in Vault 1.21.

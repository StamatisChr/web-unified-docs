#### List parameter evaluation

In Vault v1.20 and earlier, when a request parameter carrying a list value matches
an `allowed_parameters` or `denied_parameters` policy rule, Vault checks for an exact
match between each allowed or denied value in the policy and the **entire** list value in
the request parameter. This behavior can produce unexpected results.

For example, if `allowed_parameters` is set to `"X": ["A", "B"]`, Vault would allow a
request subject to that policy with parameter `"X": "A"` or `"X": "B"`, but would **deny**
one with parameter `"X": ["A", "B"]`, `"X": ["B", "A"]` or even `"X": ["A"]`, because
none of those list values exactly match one of the allowed values "A" or "B".

The same logic applies to `denied_parameters`: if it is set to `"Y": ["C", "D"]`,
Vault **allows** a request with parameter `"Y": ["C", "D"]`, which can lead to
unauthorized access if the intent was to deny any request that includes "C", "D"
or both. As a result, we **strongly recommend** using `allowed_parameters` instead of
`denied_parameters` for list parameters.

Additionally, Vault v1.20 and earlier does not treat comma-separated strings in request
parameters as lists when evaluating `allowed_parameters` and `denied_parameters`.
For instance, configuring `denied_parameters` as `"Z": ["C", "D", ["C"], ["D"], ["C", "D"], ["D", "C"]]`
does not block requests that set `"Z": "C,D"` or `"Z": "D,C"`

Vault 1.21.0 and later corrects all of these unexpected behaviors.

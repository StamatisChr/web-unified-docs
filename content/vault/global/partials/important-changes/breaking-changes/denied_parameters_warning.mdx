!> **Warning:** In Vault versions 1.20 and earlier, attributes of type list had a different behavior
with allowed_parameters and denied_parameters. In order for the list to be considered
denied, it didn't matter that some or all values in the list appeared under
denied_parameters, only that the list as a whole was defined as a single denied value.
This has been changed in Vault 1.21.
